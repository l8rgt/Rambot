Add "index.py" file with variable "clientAuth" equal to your token to use the bot. Make sure to update the message and channel in "v2.py".
If needed, update prefix in "prefix.json"

Note: the program calls "v2.py" instead of having the message in the cog in order to make it easier to call the command via a webhook if the user does not want to use the command
